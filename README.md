# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I've been in the web development game for quite a while. I enjoy writing code that's as simple and readable as it is functional. My areas of expertise include technologies like React, TypeScript, and NextJS, but Iâ€™m always exploring new tools and approaches.

Coding is as much about community as it is about solving problems, so Iâ€™m always open to discussions or questions about technology. Whether youâ€™re stuck on a tricky problem or just want to share some cool ideas, Iâ€™m all ears.

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk code, brainstorm on a project, or need some insights on web development.
